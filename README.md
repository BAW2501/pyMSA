PyMSA is an open source software tool aimed at providing a number of scores for
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) problems.

## Features
The scores that are currently available are:
* Sum of pairs,
* Star,
* Minimum entropy,
* Percentage of non-gaps,
* Percentage of totally conserved columns *and*
* [STRIKE](http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects/strike/) (*S*ingle s*TR*ucture *I*nduced *E*valuation).

## Downloading
To download PyMSA just clone the Git repository hosted in GitHub:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/benhid/pyMSA.git
$ python setup.py install
```

Alternatively, you can install with pip:
```bash
$ pip install pyMSA
```

## Requirements
PyMSA has been developed with Python 3.6.0 :: [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io) 4.3.0 (x86_64).

To install all dependencies use:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
An example of running all the included scores is located in the [`example`](example/) folder.
